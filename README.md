# VRP Demo

Public demonstration layer for the VRP protocol.  
Includes visualizations, mock sessions, and preview tools for understanding VRP behavior.

## Structure

- `src/websocket/` — event stream listener (planned)
- `src/mock/` — mock VRP sessions and movement flows
- `src/ui/` — minimal UI for visualizing routing behavior
- `docs/` — demo overview and usage notes

## Status

Source code is being prepared for structured release once the WebSocket event stream is finalized.

jumping-vpn/ ├── clients/        # platform-specific clients ├── docs/           # public documentation └── config/         # example configurations

Example config:

`yaml server: vpn.example.com port: 443 protocol: udp

auth: type: token token: "your-token-here"

routing: mode: "jumping" `

🧭 Status Jumping VPN is in the preparation phase.
Source code will be released in structured phases aligned with mutation cycles.

This repository is a window — not the engine.

🔹 Mock Session Demo A safe conceptual demo is available:

cd docs/demo chmod +x mock-session.sh ./mock-session.sh

Simulates:

mutation cycles
guardian observation
client heartbeat
No real routing or cryptography is exposed.
