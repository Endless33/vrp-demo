# VRP Demo

VRP Demo is the public demonstration layer of the VRP protocol.

It provides:
- visual previews of VRP phases and movement
- mock sessions for testing and experimentation
- WebSocket-based event streams
- tools for understanding how VRP behaves without exposing internal logic

This repository does not contain VRP Core or protocol algorithms.  
It is designed for demonstrations, presentations, and public testing.
